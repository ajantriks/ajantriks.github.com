        <h1>Introduction to 'WhatsApp Moment in Indian Banking: Annual Report 2017'</h1>
        <h6>September 16, 2018</h6>
        <h6>This is a brief introduction written for a paper presented at '<a href="http://sarai.net/lives-of-data-v2-0-computing-money-media-workshop-05-06-january-2018/" target="_blank">Lives of Data v.2.0</a>' workshop organised by the Sarai programme in Delhi on January 5-6, 2018. The presentation was titled 'WhatsApp Moment in Indian Banking: Annual Report 2017'.</h6>
	    <p>The title of this paper is inspired by a possibility of thinking of ‘annual report’ as a genre of writing history of the contemporary. An annual report takes the previous and ongoing year as a temporal frame for describing the activities undertaken by the relevant actors and thus constituting the phenomenon concerned. This specific temporal framing is usually necessitated by demands of financial and operational reporting and accountability. Annual reports, however, are simultaneously expected to be more than a description of events that have taken place over the year concerned. The annual report narrativises the common motivations behind and connections between such events, and locates that year-of-events within the past and future years of the actors concerned.</p> 
        <p>Each annual report attempts to locate the events-of-the-year within a landscape of past and future events extending far beyond the year concerned; and thus to retell the past and the future of the actors concerned. It is in this sense I am considering an ‘annual report’ as a potential genre of writing history of the contemporary. The narrow temporal focus of an ‘annual report’ seems to be particularly useful when encountering a dense landscape of simultaneous and perpetual events (and actors): all interconnected yet autonomous and competing to emerge as the true manifestation, that is as the true meaning, of the phenomenon concerned – WhatsApp moment in Indian banking. This is an annual report of a moment, or a report of a year in the life of the moment.</p> 
        <p>Paul Virilio writes that “[a] landscape of time in which events suddenly take the place of relief, of vegetation [is] a place where nothing follows on from anything else any more and yet where nothing ever ends [and] is oriented only by the itinerary of the passerby.”[1]</p>
        <p>Now, to write a report of the annual landscape of events is to face “the [reality of the] temporal horizon [...] based exclusively on the crest of the anecdotes and ravages of a present that has no future and whose only legatee seems to be the science of statistics [… or worse,] the acceleration of the reality of time [that] causes revulsion at the being-here-present. Like fright, which results in the body’s retreat, evaporation of hope in the future causes us to regress, inducing permanent resentment.”[2]</p>
        <p>The annual report is a devise of self-reassurance – an article of faith of angels of history of the contemporary – <u>an invention of futures for present catastrophes</u>.</p>
